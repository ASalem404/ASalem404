# Hi there, I'm Ahmed! 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on backend development.
Currently, I'm on an exciting journey to expand my expertise in cloud computing and AWS.
My goal those days is to obtain the AWS Developer Associate certificate to further enhance my skills and open up new opportunities.

## 💼 Professional Background

- 🔧 Backend Development: I have hands-on experience in building robust and scalable backend systems using technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- 🌐 Web Technologies: I'm well-versed in web development, and I've worked with frameworks like Express.js, and a lot of its important helper packages.
- 🚀 Cloud Computing: I'm currently diving deep into AWS services, learning how to design, deploy, and maintain cloud-based solutions.
- 📦 Containers and Orchestration: I have a keen interest in containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

## 📚 Learning AWS

My AWS journey involves mastering various AWS services, understanding cloud architecture, and adopting best practices for building secure and efficient cloud-native applications.
Here are some of the AWS topics. I already have some, and I'm actively exploring others:

- ☁️ AWS Services: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, and more.
- 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Using tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform to manage infrastructure.
- 🔒 Security Best Practices: Implementing security measures and compliance in AWS.
- 🌐 Serverless Computing: Leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway for serverless applications.
- 🔄 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Automating deployments with AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.
